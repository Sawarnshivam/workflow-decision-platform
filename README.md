# 🚀 Configurable Workflow Decision Platform

A modular rule-based decision platform that processes requests using configurable workflows and business rules.

The system exposes a REST API that evaluates rules, interacts with external services, and determines a final decision through a workflow engine.

---

## ✨ Features

- REST API using FastAPI
- Modular rule engine
- Configurable workflow using JSON
- External dependency simulation
- Retry logic for external service failures
- Request state tracking
- Audit logging
- Test scenarios

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

The platform follows a modular architecture where each component has a specific responsibility.

### API Layer
Handles incoming HTTP requests using FastAPI.

### Decision Engine
Coordinates the entire decision process by invoking the rule engine and workflow engine.

### Rule Engine
Evaluates business rules sequentially.

Implemented rules:
- Income Rule
- Duplicate Rule
- Credit Rule

### External Services
A simulated credit scoring service represents an external dependency.

### Workflow Engine
Determines the final decision based on rule evaluation results.

Workflow behavior is configurable using JSON.

### State Manager
Tracks request states.

### Audit Manager
Logs system events such as rule evaluations and final decisions.

## ⚖ Design Trade-offs

To keep the implementation simple and suitable for demonstration, several design trade-offs were made:

- **In-memory state management** is used instead of a database to simplify setup.
- **Sequential rule evaluation** is used instead of parallel processing for clarity.
- **External services are simulated** rather than integrating real third-party APIs.
- **Workflow configuration is JSON-based**, which improves flexibility but may require validation in larger systems.

---

## 📌 Assumptions

The system design assumes:

- Each request contains a unique `request_id`.
- Rules return deterministic `PASS` or `FAIL` results.
- External service failures are temporary and can be retried.
- Workflow decisions are based on aggregated rule results.
- The system runs as a single service instance for this assignment.

---

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. Client sends a request to the REST API.
2. API forwards the request to the Decision Engine.
3. Decision Engine triggers the Rule Engine.
4. Rule Engine evaluates all rules.
5. Credit Rule interacts with the external credit service.
6. Rule results are sent to the Workflow Engine.
7. Workflow Engine determines the final decision.
8. State Manager records the request state.
9. Audit Manager logs system events.
10. The API returns the final decision to the client.

## ⚙ Installation

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Sawarnshivam/workflow-decision-platform.git
```

Navigate to project folder

```
cd workflow-decision-platform
```

Create virtual environment

```
python -m venv venv
```

Activate environment (Windows)

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶ Running the Application

Start the API server

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Open interactive API documentation

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

---

## 🔗 API Endpoint

POST `/process_request`

Example request

```json
{
 "request_id": 10,
 "income": 75000,
 "is_duplicate": false
}
```

Example response

```json
{
 "request_id": 10,
 "decision": "APPROVE",
 "rules": [
   {"rule": "income_rule", "result": "PASS"},
   {"rule": "duplicate_rule", "result": "PASS"},
   {"rule": "credit_rule", "result": "PASS", "score": 645}
 ]
}
```

---

## 🔄 Workflow Configuration

Workflow logic is defined in

```
config/workflow_config.json
```

Example configuration

```json
{
  "workflow": {
    "start": "RULE_CHECK",
    "steps": {
      "RULE_CHECK": {
        "on_pass": "APPROVE",
        "on_fail": "REJECT"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This allows workflow changes without modifying the application code.

---
## ⚙ Configuration Model

The platform is designed to allow **workflows and rules to be configurable without modifying the core system logic**.

### Workflow Configuration

Workflow behavior is defined in the configuration file:

```
config/workflow_config.json
```

Example:

```json
{
  "workflow": {
    "start": "RULE_CHECK",
    "steps": {
      "RULE_CHECK": {
        "on_pass": "APPROVE",
        "on_fail": "REJECT"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration determines how rule evaluation results translate into final workflow decisions.

For example:

| Rule Result | Workflow Action |
|-------------|----------------|
PASS | APPROVE |
FAIL | REJECT |

Updating this file allows workflow behavior to change without modifying application code.

---

### Rule Configuration

Rules are implemented as modular components inside the `rules/` folder.

```
rules/
 ├── income_rule.py
 ├── duplicate_rule.py
 └── credit_rule.py
```

Each rule follows a common interface:

```
evaluate(data) → PASS / FAIL
```

Example rule configuration:

- **Income Rule** → checks minimum income threshold
- **Duplicate Rule** → checks duplicate requests
- **Credit Rule** → checks credit score via external service

New rules can be added by implementing a new rule class and registering it in the Rule Engine.

---

### Benefits of This Configuration Model

- Allows **workflow logic to change without code modifications**
- Enables **easy addition of new rules**
- Supports **extensibility for new decision workflows**
- Keeps business logic **separate from system infrastructure**

This design makes the system flexible and adaptable to different decision-making scenarios.

## 🧪 Running Tests

Run test scenarios

```
python -m tests.test_requests
```

Test cases include

- Successful approval
- Low income rejection
- Duplicate request rejection
- External service failure handling

---
## 🧪 Test Coverage

The system includes test scenarios that validate different decision paths and failure conditions.

Tests can be executed using:

```
python -m tests.test_requests
```

### Covered Test Scenarios

| Scenario | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Happy Path** | Valid request where all rules pass and the workflow returns **APPROVE** |
| **Low Income / Rule Failure** | Request fails income rule resulting in **REJECT** |
| **Duplicate Request** | Duplicate request detection triggers rule failure |
| **Dependency Failure** | External credit service may fail and simulate service errors |
| **Retry Flow** | Credit rule retries the external service before returning failure |
| **Rule Change Scenario** | Workflow decisions adapt automatically based on rule evaluation results |

### Example Test Cases

The test file `tests/test_requests.py` includes:

- `test_success_case()` → validates successful approval
- `test_low_income()` → validates rule failure scenario
- `test_duplicate_request()` → validates duplicate detection
- `test_external_failure()` → validates external dependency handling

These tests ensure the decision platform behaves correctly across both normal and failure scenarios.
